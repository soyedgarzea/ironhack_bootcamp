## About Lend

Lend is an app that let you search anything and contact its owner to get the item for a couple days.

You just have to type the name or de brand of the item and you'll get some results.

When you decide which article you're interested, click it and will display the item owner's profile so you can see all the articles and all the recommendations that other users done.

Then, click Contact so the last page is about the subtotal of the prices and is the way you can contact the owner.

Once you have chosen the articles, at bottom of the page you can decide which way you want to contact, by email or by whatsapp.
